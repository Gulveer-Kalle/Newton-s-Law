# Newton's Law Game

A fun, interactive game where the player catches falling apples in a moving basket.

## Description

In **Newton's Law**, you control a basket that moves left and right at the bottom of the screen. Apples fall from a tree at the top, and your goal is to catch them in the basket. The game ends when an apple hits the ground.

## Features

- **Gravity Simulation**: Apples fall from the tree due to gravity.
- **Physics**: Basket movement, apple collisions, and scoring mechanics are governed by physics.
- **Simple Gameplay**: Move the basket to catch apples and score points.
- **Responsive Design**: The game adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Restart Functionality**: Game can be restarted after it ends.

## How to Play

1. Click anywhere on the screen to start the game.
2. Use the moving basket to catch falling apples.
3. Score points for each apple caught.
4. The game ends if an apple touches the ground.
5. Click to restart after the game ends.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**
- **p5.js** - for rendering graphics and managing the game loop.
- **Matter.js** - for physics simulation (gravity, collisions, and movement).
