# Newton's Law Game

A fun, interactive game where the player drops apples into a moving basket.

## Description

In **Newton's Law**, apples hang from a tree and a basket moves automatically at the bottom of the screen. Your job is to click on apples to drop them. The goal is to time your drops so the apples land in the basket. Every successful catch increases your score and makes the basket move faster. The game ends if any apple hits the ground.
